Multimodal-Brain-Computer-Interfaces (EXPECT A BIG UPDATE SOON!)
====================================
My research to using convolutional neural network architectures for decoding visual stimuli with EEGs.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Background Info
This is a multidisciplinary research project, branching accross the fields of Neuroscience, Electrical Engineering,
 and Computer Science. Five programming languages were utilized to bring this research to fruition i.e. "**Processing**,
 **Java**, **Batch**, **MATLAB**, and **Python**". These languages provided the means to have a UI to collect the data with,
 preprocess the data, and run the encoded data through a convolutional neural network (CNN).

## Reminder
I will refer to different project components throughout this page as (1, 2, or 3).

## Project Components
1. Data Acquisition
2. Preprocessing
3. Creating the Classifier
